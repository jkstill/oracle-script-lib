-- Script to Collect Log File Sync Diagnostic Information (lfsdiag.sql) (Doc ID 1064487.1)
-- PURPOSE:
-- This script is intended to provide a user friendly guide to troubleshoot
-- log file sync waits. The script will look at important parameters involved
-- in log file sync waits, log file sync wait histogram data, and the script
-- will look at the worst average log file sync times in the active session
-- history data and AWR data and dump information to help determine why those
-- times were the highest. The script will create a file called
-- lfsdiag_<timestamp>.out in your local directory.

/*

Yes, summing and averaging TIME_WAITED from ASH/AWR is "wrong"

This is because not all waits are captured in ASH, and AWR is a 10% sample

However, if a significant amount of time appears, I believe it is good to know that.

Just keep in mind that the amount of time is not accurate, it is lower than the real amount of time

PROMPT sync time greater than the threshold will be analyzed further.
