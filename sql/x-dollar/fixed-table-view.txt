GV$FIXED_TABLE
-- kernel query, fixed table
-- Base table of v$fixed_table, whose object_id (indx of x$kqfta) matches obj# of tab_stats$, 
-- the table dbms_stats.gather_fixed_objects_stats inserts stats into.

union all 
-- kernel query, fixed derived table
-- Contains x$kglcursor, x$kgltable etc. which are based on x$kglob; effectively these are views 
-- of other x$ tables, but Oracle couldn't call them views because they already had x$kqfvi.
